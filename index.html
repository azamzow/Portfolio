                        After graduating in May of 2018 from Sam Houston State University, I became an Intern at Feniex Industries where 
                        I worked with a variety of departments such as engineering and marketing. I am a full stack software developer 
                        currently seeking a career opportunity where I can add value to a company while also expanding and developing my knowledge base. 
                        I design, develop, troubleshoot, and debug software programs for databases, applications, tools, networks, etc. 
                        Being extremely motivated prepares me to work in a highly-collaborative, team-oriented environment. <br />
                        I am self-motivated and can work well independently; however, I’m also able to work in a team environment. 
                        My attitude, work ethic, and flexible schedule help prepare me in areas outside my comfort zone when necessary and essential. 
                        In my experience, I have learned that being organized, reliable, and able to efficiently manage multiple tasks are crucial 
                        characteristics of software developers.  <br /><br />

                    Feniex is a manufacturing company that produces light and sound equipment for emergency, off road, and public work vehicles. Their
                    products apply to police, fire, EMS, construction vehicles and more.<br />
                    I started my internship working with the engineering departemnt. Using React Native, I repaired an abandoned application, then updated it to have 
                    the correct products and features for company and customer use.
                    Then I joined the marketing departemnt where I assisted the web team in developing a brand new platform for their website called Build-A-Bar
                    (Read more about Build-A-Bar below). This web application was built using Angular for the front-end and Druple for the back-end.

                        <h3>Code Chat</h3>
                        <p>
                             During my senior year, I worked with a 9-man team to design and build a project that could benefit programmers all over the world. 
                             Before developing CodeChat, my peers and I 
                             were having trouble sharing compiled code with each other. 
                             Since there was no code sharing platform on the market that was
                             chat friendly, we decided to build the application ourselves.
                             This allows users to see the compiled code immediately
                             so that there is a faster learning experience. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was the assistant programmer for most of the
                            JavaScript modules within the back-end. Our whole system utilizes websockets between the webapp, the chat server,
                            and the compiling server, making it as network performant as possible.

                        <p>
                            Build-A-Bar is a way to design and personalize your own emergancy lightbar. The user begins with two options, single or dual color. 
                            The dual option allows reversal of the LED's and specific color cordinations such as "Dual Flood" or "Amber Arrow". Color cordination differes within each product.
                            The user can then 'build a bar'. Build-A-Bar is unique because no other Emergancy Lighting company provides customization like this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project was built using Angular, JavaScript, and HTML with SASS and CSS. Each bar's information is stored using an object. Once an object is created it gets pushed in an array.
                            When the bar is complete, the array is sorted using bubble sort and is sent to the manufacturing department. The user also has the option to download a PDF of their 
                            built bar. This ensures that each order is accurate.
